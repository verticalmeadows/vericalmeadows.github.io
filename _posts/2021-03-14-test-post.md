# Data import

First we import the linguistic distances in a dyadic form and cast the linguistic distance coloumn into a matrix (and enhance it with a symmetric lower triangle and a dialgonal).

filter it to Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu (HSK) by latitude. Remove sites 277 and 288, somehow no linguistic distances calculated for them
